# Abinod

Official website for [Abinod](https://www.abinod.com/), a founder-led software company building infrastructure products for modern applications.

Abinod exists to create products that help software remain understandable as it grows. Its first product is Ambiten, a context-aware runtime for modern multi-tenant systems.

Install dependencies:

Start the production server locally:

```bash
npm start
```

Start the development server with Node watch mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

By default, the site runs at:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

## Contact Form

The contact form posts to `/api/contact`. In production, the Vercel Function
sends the message to:

```text
contact@abinod.com
```

Messages are sent by email and are not stored in a database. If email delivery
is unavailable, the frontend shows a mailto fallback.

General enquiries and partnerships: [contact@abinod.com](mailto:contact@abinod.com).
Product support for Ambiten and VeriNodo: [support@abinod.com](mailto:support@abinod.com).

## Cookies And Consent

The website shows a bottom consent banner for first-time visitors. Visitors can accept all optional cookies, reject optional cookies, or save preferences for preference and analytics cookies.

The consent choice is stored in a first-party cookie named:

```text
abinod_cookie_consent
```

## Service Worker

The site registers `sw.js` to cache core static assets for faster repeat visits and basic offline resilience.

## Production Workflow

The production GitHub Actions workflow lives at:

```text
.github/workflows/production.yml
```

It runs on pushes to `main` and can also be started manually from GitHub Actions.

The workflow:

- Installs dependencies with `npm ci`
- Checks JavaScript syntax
- Starts the production server
- Smoke-tests the main public routes
- Smoke-tests the local contact fallback
- Prints server logs if something fails

## Deploying On Vercel

The static website can be deployed on Vercel. The contact API and health check
live in the `api/` directory:

```text
api/contact.js
api/health.js
```

No database environment variables are required. Add these SMTP variables in the
Vercel dashboard:

```text
SMTP_HOST
SMTP_PORT
SMTP_USER
SMTP_PASS
SMTP_FROM
CONTACT_TO=contact@abinod.com
```

`SMTP_FROM` should usually be the same mailbox as `SMTP_USER`, or another
verified sender allowed by the SMTP provider. You can verify the deployed API
configuration at:

```text
https://www.abinod.com/api/health
```

## Open Graph

The website uses this shared Open Graph and Twitter card image:
